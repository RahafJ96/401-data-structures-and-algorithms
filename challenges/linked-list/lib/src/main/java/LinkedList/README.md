# Singly Linked List
- Is a linear data structure that consists of nodes and each node have the data that it hold and the reference to the next node ,
  Nodes are connected using the next reference which can be scattered and doesn't need to have the adjacent references .

## Challenge
- Implement the linked list using the node and linked list classes .

## Approach & Efficiency
Used Classes to implement the linked list with the O(1) and O(n) for it's methods .
